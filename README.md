# Godot Steam Multiplayer

A simple multiplayer game template using Godot and Steam networking. This project demonstrates the integration of **Steamworks** for lobby creation, real-time player movement synchronization, and in-game chat functionality.

## Setup

### Requirements:
1. **Godot Engine** (v4.4.1)
2. **Steam**

### Steps:   
1. **Ensure Steam is Running**:
   - Steam must be running to use Steam features like lobbies and P2P networking. [Make sure to run in Compatibility mode if you want the Steam Overlay to work when running through the editor.](https://godotsteam.com/issues/common_issues/#steam-overlay)

2. **Set Your Steam AppID**:
   - In the `global.gd` script, set your **Steam AppID** to `480` for testing purposes. You can replace it later with your actual AppID when ready to publish.

3. **Run the Project**:
   - Open the project in Godot or export it and run it.

## Features

- **Create and Join Steam Lobbies**: Up to 4 players in a lobby.
- **Real-Time Player Movement Synchronization**: Player positions are synced between clients.
- **In-Game Chat**: Chat functionality for communication between players.
- **P2P Networking via Steam**: Peer-to-peer networking for real-time multiplayer gameplay.
